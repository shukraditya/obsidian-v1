Why?
Precision medicine improves on the traditional symptom driven practise of medicine. **Allows for prevention instead of cure.**
The best way to medicine is the ability to analyze patient data along with monitoring and differentiating between sick and relatively healthy people for better understanding of biological indicators.
The best way is by taking medical data from data sources and discovering patient specific pattterns of disease progression.
Developing multifunctional ML platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis to understand specifics and optimise the decision making. 
**Focus of Study**: Analysing, discussing various published AI and ML solns and perspectives aimed to advance academic solutions in paving way for new data centric era of discovery in health care.


To effectively implement healthcare analytic processes, big data management challenges that are faced are:
1)  existence of multiple data standards, structures, types and formats
2) rapid growth in heterogeneous data
3) understanding of analysis algorithms for clinical data interpretation,exploration and drawing inference
4) unavailability of effective open- source tools that combine various approaches to model biological interactions; integration of clinical and analytic systems
5) interdisciplinary field barriers
6) high cost(21)
7) implementation of secure frameworks for data collection, simplification, conversion from raw form to knowledge, management and distribution (22,23)
8) automatic cleansing of faulty and error-prone EHRs(electronic health records)
9) correctly identifying prescription medication
10) implementing predictive diagnostics (10)


Focus: 
Discuss valued contributions of all mentioned AI ML Algorithms. 3 categories:
1) Health Intelligence
2) Precision Medicine
3) healthcare Resource Management
4) Ethical Challenges
