#### Black Box Warning
Boxed warning or contradiction by the US FDA for prescription medicine. Named after the black border surrounding the warning on the drug's packaging and prescribing information. 
Used for meds that have severe side effects, adverse reactions or potential dangers when in certain patient populations or in combination with other drugs.

#### Why use AI?
Earlier, each update for the detection algorithm based on different parameters results in a new generation.
Deep learning algorithms allows for machines to receive data and self-develop complex functions to provide predictions.
AI system can largely automate medical record documentation - the easier it will be to allow the technologies into the clinic. 
Without a thorough understanding of how the AI is working it is difficult to assuage the fear of "runway machines".



## Case Study:
###### Skin Cancer
Difficulties:
 - Dermatologist in shortage already 
 - Melanoma 5 year survival is 99% for early stage vs 14% for last stage [[Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks]]
 - Skin examination is time taking and difficult, requiring dermatologist expertize.
